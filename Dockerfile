# Caddy serves the static apps AND reverse-proxies /intuition/* to the Intuition
# publisher (a bun process) running in this same container. One deploy, one origin,
# no CORS. The publisher holds INTUITION_ATTESTOR_PK + PINATA_JWT as RUNTIME env
# (never VITE_ — those are baked into the public bundle). If the publisher can't
# start (e.g. missing key), Caddy still serves the site; auto-publish just degrades.
